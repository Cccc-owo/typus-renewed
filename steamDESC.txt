Typus Orbis Terrarum is a map overhaul mod focused on correcting the physical geography of the game, featuring a new map projection and terrain map, with hand-drawn coastlines and rivers. It does not change vanilla's province layout or balance.

While aesthetically enjoyable on it’s own, this mod is designed to be a resource for other mods to use as a base. Any modder has my permission to repurpose it however they wish for any EU4 mod, so long as credit is given to the original.

Compatible with v1.34.

Only a few changes are made in order to follow vanilla game & original Typus map.

Great thanks to bizarcasm for making such an amazing map mod!
